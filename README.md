# SCIP Study
My exercises from MIT's [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)

**Disclaimer:** These excercises may be ugly, or incomplete but they are for my personal learning purpose only. Don't assume they are correct and take time to read the book and get your own solutions, it's a lot  of fun.
